This repository contains all the codes, explanations and projects by me regarding the Computational Geometry course at the Theoretical Computer Science graduate studies.

It will consists of all the topics covered during the course using the Mark De Berg book _Computational Geometry_ and it will be organized in folders, for example the SimplePolygon:

SimplePolygon
|
|-> Theory.ipynb
|-> Problems.ipynb

Theory will consists of definitions, visualizations, theorems with proofs and algorithms that will be covered. I will also include my own understandings of the things we discuss in the notebooks. Hopefully my explanations will be valuable to anyone interested to gain a deeper understanding on the subject.

Problems notebook consists a set of problems with solutions in the certain topic. For example, we could have problems solvable only using the proof methods, others require certain algorithms to solve the problem.

In the repository, you will also find a python package called _comgeo_, which basically puts all the necessary definitions and properties of geometric structures in one package so it can be used to solve problems in various topics. If you are interested, contact me for further development of comgeo package to be published in PyPI.

The ending result should be a rather large repository with rich material filled with problems and listed their solutions (which will be solved by the author). I will also rank the problem difficulties in order for the reader to see which problems are classified as Easy, Doable and Hard, which will depend on how I view those problems.

Enjoy exploring these topics, as I find them really fascinating!
