Let's connect those two points and form a new edge that will form a new polygon $Q$ from $A$ with an edge $\\overline{x_1x_2}$ and observe it's perimeter.\n",

Of course, there can be as many points as we want between $x_1$ and $x_2$, but the basic idea remains the same, so we will just observe one of those vertices. If we have edges $\\overline{x_1y}$ and $\\overline{yx_2}$ from polygon $A$, it's sum is included in its perimeter. But, if we observe the polygon $Q$, which has only the difference from $A$ that it's $x_1$ and $x_2$ points are now directly forming the edge instead with other vertex $y$ after $x_1$ and before $x_2$, we can now form a triangle $\\triangle x_1yx_2$ and we get the triangle inequality\n",

That means the polygon $Q$ has smaller perimeter than polygon $A$, which is impossible, since polygon $A$ is, by assumption, the polygon with smallest perimeter that contains $P$. We got the contradiction from the assumption that polygon with smallest perimeter is not convex, so it has to be convex. $\\blacksquare$"
